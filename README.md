This is the final project of the course Lập Trình Kỹ Thuật Nâng Cao. 
This project is an application for learning English sentences. 
Specifically, when entering certain English sentences, setting a time, the number of repetitions, and then pressing the Start button, the timer will count down.
When the time is up, it will play the sound of reading the English sentences previously entered with the corresponding number of repetitions.
After the sound finishes, the timer will start counting down again, and repeat until the Stop button is pressed. 
Besides, this application has some other functions to help learn English sentences better.
Hope you will have an enjoyable experience with this application!!
